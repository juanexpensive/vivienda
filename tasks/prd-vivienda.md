# PRD: Vivienda

## Introduction

`Vivienda` is a small data product focused on showing how housing prices have evolved over time across Spanish provinces using public INE data. The goal is to build a visually strong, easy-to-understand portfolio project that lets a user explore historical trends, identify which provinces have risen the most, and understand territorial differences through charts, rankings, and a map.

This first version is designed to be realistic for a short delivery window while still feeling like a polished product instead of a class exercise.

## Goals

- Visualize the historical evolution of housing prices by province in a clear and interactive way.
- Highlight which provinces have experienced the highest cumulative growth over time.
- Provide a simple geographic overview through a map colored by latest value or variation.
- Deliver a portfolio-ready web app with a clean interface and a clear data story.
- Keep the first version intentionally scoped so it can be completed in a few days.

## Functional Requirements

- FR-1: The system must ingest a public INE housing-price dataset suitable for historical territorial analysis.
- FR-2: The system must normalize the data into a structure that supports filtering by province and period.
- FR-3: The system must let the user select a province as the main analysis target.
- FR-4: The system must display a historical line chart for the selected province.
- FR-5: The system must let the user limit the visible analysis to a selected time range.
- FR-6: The system must calculate and display summary metrics for the selected province and range.
- FR-7: The system must rank provinces by variation across the selected period.
- FR-8: The system must display a Spain map with provincial coloring based on a selected metric when geometry data is available.
- FR-9: The system must show a legend and clear labeling for all visual encodings.
- FR-10: The system must generate concise text insights based only on the loaded data.
- FR-11: The system must provide explicit loading, empty, and error states.
- FR-12: The system must render a responsive interface appropriate for desktop and mobile use.
- FR-13: The system must make the recommended stack explicit in project documentation, even if the implementation decision is finalized later.

## Non-Goals

- No price prediction, forecasting, or machine learning models.
- No authentication, accounts, or user-specific saved dashboards.
- No advanced custom frontend architecture that slows delivery of the first version.
- No real estate listing search or integration with private portals.
- No municipal or neighborhood-level analysis unless the selected dataset directly supports it and the scope is reconsidered.
- No download center, reporting engine, or PDF export in the first version.

## Design Considerations

- The interface should feel like a compact analytical product, not a notebook with widgets.
- The top of the page should communicate the app value immediately with a strong title and one-sentence explanation.
- KPI cards should sit near the top so the user gets an instant summary before reading the chart.
- The main line chart should be the visual centerpiece.
- Ranking and map should complement the chart rather than compete with it.
- The language should stay simple and explanatory because the likely audience includes recruiters and non-specialists.

## Technical Considerations

- Python with Streamlit is the recommended implementation path because it enables fast delivery and a polished UI with low frontend overhead.
- The PRD does not fully lock the stack, but any alternative should preserve the fast-delivery goal.
- The INE API or dataset access pattern should be validated early, including field naming, territorial granularity, and update cadence.
- A local cached data file may be useful to avoid repeated API calls during development or demo sessions.
- Provincial map rendering may require an external GeoJSON or shapefile source compatible with the chosen province identifiers.
- Data transformation logic should be separated from UI rendering so the app can be maintained and extended later.

## Success Metrics

- A user can choose a province and understand its historical trend within the first 30 seconds of use.
- The app can answer both of these questions clearly: "How has this province evolved?" and "Which provinces have risen the most?"
- The interface works reliably in a live demo without broken states caused by common data issues.
- The finished project is strong enough to include in a CV or portfolio with a public demo and screenshots.
- The first version is implementable within a short timebox of a few days.

## Open Questions

- Which exact INE dataset should be used as the canonical source for the first release?
- Should the default map metric be latest value, accumulated variation, or percentage variation?
- Should the ranking show absolute change, percentage change, or allow switching between both?
- Is province-level coverage complete enough in the selected dataset, or will the first version need fallback support for autonomous communities?
- Should the app name remain `Vivienda`, or should it be renamed later for stronger portfolio branding?
